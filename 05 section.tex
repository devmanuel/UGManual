\section{Registration }

Each admitted student is required to register before commencement of a semester in order to enroll for that particular semester. The registration process consists of administrative registration and academic registration.

\subsection{Administrative Registration}

Administrative registration deals with matters related to fee payment. Students must comply to the following to complete the administrative registration.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Payment of all fees as applicable and clearance of all outstanding dues if any.
    \item Issue or renewal of identity cards if required as per the institute rules.
    \item Any other process stipulated by the institute.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Academic Registration}

Academic registration involves the selection of courses consistent with the specified credit requirements and is subject to the rules described below. Registration is done at the beginning of each semester on the prescribed dates announced in the academic calendar and it is mandatory for every student until they complete their academic program. The student may be considered de-registered from the program if they fail to register during the specified window.

On joining the Institute, each student is assigned to a Faculty Adviser and the student can register for courses only with the approval from their Faculty Advisers. Students should contact their respective Faculty Advisers for consultation on selection of courses and registration.

IIT Goa has an online registration system accessible through the institute website. The registration instructions are shared with registration email and institute intranet.

\subsubsection{Registration for the First Two Semesters}

In each of the first two semesters of the program, a student is required to register for all the courses listed in the curriculum for the semester. In addition, students who are identified as academically weak at the end of the first semester may be prescribed a specially worked out load in consultation with the Faculty Advisor.

\subsubsection{Registration for Third and Subsequent semesters}

From third semester onwards, a student is required to register for the number of credits as prescribed by the curriculum of their program taking into account the provisions in the academic progression policy. The faculty advisor may recommend a reduced load for students with backlogs after considering the regulations as decided by the SUGC in the academic progression policy.

\subsubsection{Registration for Summer Term}

Only in case the number of students with backlog in a course is greater than or equal to five, the concerned program may offer this course during summer vacation subject to availability/ willingness of the faculty member. Summer courses with less number of students are discouraged. Such a proposal should come from the PUGC and be approved by the Dean (AP). Students can register for a maximum of 4 Courses during summer program on payment of the prescribed registration fees. The course instructor will monitor the attendance of the students registered and he/she may award “FX” grade as per rule for poor attendance. The summer course facility provides the opportunity to the students to clear their backlogs, by re-doing courses with adequate rigor, provided it is offered. Students are also not permitted to re-register for courses, which they have already obtained a passing grade. The registration, examination etc. will be as per academic calendar and the evaluation/ grading will be done in the similar way as is done for normal semester courses. 

\subsection{Rules Regarding Academic Registration}

\subsubsection{General Rule}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item A registration is considered valid only if there is no timetable conflict between the courses for which the student has registered. 
    \item The registration of a student in a course may be cancelled at any stage by the Academic office, if it is found that they do not meet the prerequisites for the course, or if there is a clash in the student's time table preventing her/him from attending the course or if it is found that s/he is not eligible to register for that course for any other reason.
    \item Registrations must be completed on or before the prescribed last date for registration. Late registration may be permitted only for valid reasons and on payment of a late registration fee as prescribed from time to time. 
    \item If a student does not register for a regular semester (Autumn or Spring) without prior permission from SUGC or fails to register during any semester within the prescribed timeline, the student will be deregistered from the program and considered terminated.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Adding and Dropping of Courses}

From third semester onwards, the students may choose to drop one or two courses out of the registered one(s), provided the minimum credit requirement is fulfilled. The students, however, will not be permitted to drop backlog course/s for which they have registered. Course/s dropped by a student may be taken during the summer term (if offered) or during a subsequent semester. In all the cases, course adjustments/dropping of courses must be done before the last date for Course add and drop, as announced by the Institute in its Academic Calendar. In exceptional cases, SUGC may allow adding/dropping of courses beyond deadline upon recommendation by the faculty adviser and the PUGC. This is typically reserved for medical emergencies. Adding of courses is not permitted in the summer term. However, students may drop a course up to two weeks prior to the last day of classes for summer course.

\subsubsection{Repeating a Course}

A student is required to repeat a course completely under the following situations: 

\begin{enumerate}
    \item When s/he gets a failing grade in a course. 
    \item When a student, who gets an ‘IN' grade and fails to apply or does not appear for a re-examination (giving valid/ medical reasons for absence at the end-semester examination, the grade F is awarded automatically to such course).
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Course Substitution}

The substitution of one course where the student has failed by another course in a later semester is governed by following rules.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item For an institute core or program core course (compulsory courses), no substitution is allowed and the same course must be repeated. 
    \item For an open elective course, substitution by another open elective is the only possibility. 
    \item Program electives may be substituted by another program elective course.
    \item Substitution of courses with previously overloaded courses is governed by the academic progression rules.
\end{enumerate}

SUGC is the approving authority for the course substitution.

\subsection{Special Features in Registration}

\subsubsection{Audit Course}

Auditing of courses by the Undergraduate students during regular semesters and summer term is permitted under the following conditions: 

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Students with CPI 7.5 and above will be permitted to ‘Audit' the course. However, this would be restricted to maximum of 2 courses, irrespective of passed or failed during the entire period of the program. 
    \item The audited course will not carry any credits. The course done by auditing will not be considered for the purposes of calculation of SPI/CPI but will be reflected in the Semester Grade Report as Audit Course. 
    \item Prior permission of the Instructor is required. 
    \item The ‘L' grade would be awarded by the instructor if the attendance is satisfactory (minimum 80\%) and requirements set out by the instructor are met. Students will be expected to complete the in-semester assessments. If the attendance and performance is not satisfactory grade ‘FL’ would be awarded and the course will not appear at all in the grade card. 
    \item Students can audit a course provided the course is offered and the timetable slot permits. 
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Self-Study}

Self-study mode of crediting a course is intended to provide a student with a fail grade in the given course an opportunity to complete the course credit requirements by the end of fourth year of B.Tech. program. The self-study mode will allow students to avoid time-table clash while registering for backlog courses. Student may request for self-study courses by taking necessary approval from PUGC and SUGC. Following are the modalities of the self-study.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Self-study courses can be requested only during a regular semester and only for courses which are typically offered in that semester. These courses are subject to the availability/willingness of concerned faculty members.
    \item A maximum of 3 courses can be taken as Self study mode only from semester 6 onwards.
    \item An application for self-study has to be made to the PUGC, along with the permission from the instructor of the course well before the last date for adding/ dropping courses. 
    \item The SUGC will consider each application for self-study on its merits and will restrict the total number of such courses to only three during the entire program of a student. Students who have not attempted to clear the course in a regular manner may not be considered eligible for this mode of crediting. 
    \item The registration, examination etc. will be as per academic calendar. The course should be completed and the grade obtained in the same semester in which the registration is done without any carryover from one semester to another. 
    \item The evaluation for self-study will be done in the similar way as is done for normal semester course. Academic standards must be rigorously maintained in the self-study mode. The instructor must supervise the student from time to time apart from an examination at the end of the course.
    \item The credits for a self-study course are the same as those for the regular course and will be taken into account while calculating the total credits in a semester which should not exceed the normal load. 
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Guided Study}

The capable students will be provided option of Guided study to acquire proficiency in an area of their choice, through doing courses outside their curriculum by a self-study-like mode. This option is also subject to the availability and willingness of the instructor offering the course. Such an option will be available to students with a CPI of 8.5 or more to the extent of a maximum of one course per semester in the third and subsequent years, on the recommendation of the faculty adviser/project guide, and approval of PUGC. This option is called ‘Guided Study' to distinguish it from the existing self-study mode, which is largely meant for students to clear backlogs in the curriculum. Further, even in respect of these courses, the rules that govern overloading apply strictly. The Guided study option may be used, on a case-by-case basis with prior approval of PUGC. The registration, examination etc. will be similar to a self-study course. The evaluation for guided study will be done in the similar way as is done for normal courses. This option will be made available in the following special situations also, provided CPI requirement is fulfilled: 

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Students who miss the ‘Introduction to Profession Course' due to a change of branch obtained at the end of first year. 
    \item Students dropping an entire semester due to medical reasons. 
\end{enumerate}
